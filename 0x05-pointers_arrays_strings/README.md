# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

In this project, we learnt  about pointers in C programming language. We also learned how to work with arrays and strings in C.

Here are the tasks done in this project:

## Tasks: :clipboard:

### **0. 98 Battery st.**

- Learnt about the concept of dereferencing to change the contents of a value that a pointer points to.
- Dereference n to 98 i.e ``*n = 98``

### **1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream**

- In order to swap two variable, we use a temporary variable to store one variable and then swap the variables

### **2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read**

- We first define a count, then use a ``while()`` loop to check that the *dereferenced* value of s is not ``\0``
- I learnt that pointers (which point to the first element) can be added to point to the next element in the list i.e ``s++`` points to the next element

### **3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them**

- Here, I used a loop to go through every element of the string
- Remember, when using an array indexing operation, we do not dereference to access the value in the array.

### **4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear**

- Here, I first found the length of the string and the inverted using a new variable.

### **5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes**

- Used the same intervention here

### **6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true**

- Here, i skipped every odd number by adding an incremenet of 2 in the ``for()`` loop i.e ``i += 2``

### **7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half**

- Here, find the total length, add one and then divide by 2 to get the haf point and print every character

### **8. Arrays are not pointers**

- Here, use a for loop but the increment section can have two variables increasing i.e ``n--, i++``

### **9. strcpy**

- Here, use a for loop to go through every index in the array of the source and copy it to the dest index
