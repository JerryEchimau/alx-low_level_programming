# 0x0C. C - More malloc, free

- In this task, we learnt more about dynamic memory allocation with ``malloc`` and  deallocation of dynamically allocated memory using the function ``free``
- Here are the tasks in this project:

## Tasks :clipboard:

### 0. Trust no one

- Here, we first check to see that b is not 0 or less than zero then allocate memory using malloc
- we then use exit status 98 if malloc fails

### 1. string_nconcat

- Here, we first find the length of both strings then allocate memory to a different variable and concatenate normally with the delimiter n

### 2. _calloc

- Here, we first get the total size of memory to be allocated then initialize the memory with 0

### 3. array_range

- to create an array of integers, just allocate memory to an int pointer using malloc with size of int * maz-min + 1
