# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
In this project, we learnt about if, else, and while loops.<br>
We also learnt about variables. Here are the tasks in this project.

## Tasks
### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
- We used if, else if, and else loops to loop through each condition

### 1. The last digit
- Used if, else if, and else loops

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
- We used a 'for' loop to loop through each letter of the alphabet
- second ``putchar`` is for the newline character

### 3. alphABET
- Being similar to the previous task, we used two 'for' loops to loop through lowercase alphabet and uppercase alphabet

### 4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
- Here, we used a nested 'if' loop (to print a letter if it is not 'q' and 'e' inside a for loop.

### 5. Numbers
- used a 'for' loop to go through each number and inserted a newline after each number is printed.

### 6. Numberz
- We first loop through the numbers and convert them to int values that can be printed by putchar

### 7. Smile in the mirror
- Printing reverse string necessitates using for loops from z to a

### 8. Hexadecimal
- Base 16 has 0-9 and a-f to represent 10 - 15
- Use fo loops to go through numbers (1-9) and letters (a-f)

### 9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success
- Use a loop to loop through each num (0 - 9)
