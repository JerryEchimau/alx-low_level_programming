# 0x0F. C - Function pointers

In this project, we learnt how to declare and call function pointers<br>
Here are the tasks in the project

## Tasks :clipboard:

### 0. What's my name

- Here, we simply call the function ``f`` after declaration
- We can either call using ``(*f)(args)`` or just ``f(args)``

### 1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done

- Here, we iterate through the array upto size then perform the action (dereference the pointer given)

### 2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities

- Here, we first treverse through the index, and apply appropriate operation and if cmp return anything other than 0, we return the index of the array

### 3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at

- Here, we first declare the structure from where we will match an operator and it's function
- we then define the functions
- we then write a get option function that checks for the input and compares it with the right op function
