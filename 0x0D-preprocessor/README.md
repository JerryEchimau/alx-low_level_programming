# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

- In this project, we learnt about the preprocessor, a program that processes the source code before it is compiled
- Here are the tasks in this project:

## Tasks :clipboard:

### 0. Object-like Macro

- Here, we create a header file and use include guards then define our macro

### 1. Pi

- We do the same thing here and define Pi as the value given

### 2. File name

- Here, we print the predefined __FILE__ macros using ``printf`` and a string identifier

### 3. Function-like macro

- Here, we use a *ternary operator* with the syntax ``condition ? value_if_true:value_if_false``
- We also encolse all the values in brackets for correct evaluation

### 4. SUM

- Here, we define the SUM as the addition, enclosing both variables in brackets for correct evaluation
