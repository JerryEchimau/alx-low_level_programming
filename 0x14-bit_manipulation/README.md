#0x14-bit_manipulation project
in this project, I learnt how to manipulate bits

#Tasks
## Task 0:
1. 0-binary_to_uint.c: C function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

## Task 1:
1. 1-print_binary.c: C function that prints the binary representation of a number.

##Task 2:
1. 2-get_bit.c: C function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

##Task 3:
1. 3-set_bit.c: C function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 1.

##Task 4:
1. 4-clear_bit.c: C function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 0.

##Task 5:
1. 5-flip_bits.c: C function that returns the number of bits needed to be flipped to get from one number to another.

##Task 6:
1. 100-get_endianness.c: C function that checks endianness.

##Task 7:
1. 101-password: File containing the password for the crackme3 executable.
- checked for alx tools on github
- followed the instrutions in https://github.com/osala-eng/alx_tools/blob/master/crackme3.sh to create the file 101-password
