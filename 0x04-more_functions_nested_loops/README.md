# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
In this project, we learnt more about functions and nested loops<br>

Here are the tasks in this project:<br>

## Tasks
### 0. isupper
- For this one, we can use the ASCII numbers to range the input within the uppercase requirements or we can simply us ``c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z'``

### 1. isdigit
- We do same as previous but for numbers i.e ``c >= '0' && c <= '9'``

### 2. Collaboration is multiplication
- Write a source code that returns the product

### 3. The numbers speak for themselves
- Use a ``for`` loop to print all numbers using ``_putchar``

### 4. I believe in numbers and signs
- Same as previous task but use an if statement to remove out 2 and 4 i.e ``if (i != 2 && i != 4)``

### 5. Numbers constitute the only universal language
- Use nested loop with inner loop counting to 14 and outr loop counting to 10
- Remember ``_putchar`` needs to convert numbers per dec place

### 6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line
- Use a ``for`` loop to print _ from i to n

### 7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe
- For this task, create a nested loop with the inner loop being for space and the outer loop being for slash

### 8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch
- Use nested loop with outer loop being for line and inner loop being for square

### 9. Fizz-Buzz
- In this case, use a ``for`` loop with ``if`` and ``else if`` to go through each scenario

### 10. Triangles
- Use a nested loop with parameters such as line, spcae, and hash
