# 0x10. C - Variadic functions

- In this project, we learnt about variadic functions; how to declare them, initialize them, and work with them
- Here are the tasks in the project:

## Tasks :clipboard:

### 0. Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant

- Here, we first declare a ``va_list``, then initialize it with the arguemnts starting from n, then manipulate the return list using ``va_arg``, then clean the list and return the intended sum.

### 1. To be is to be the value of a variable

- We do the same but here we simply print what is returned from the ``va_arg``

### 2. One woman's constant is another woman's variable

- Here, we do the same thing but first assign the output of ``va_arg`` to a ``char *`` in order to check whether it's NULL
