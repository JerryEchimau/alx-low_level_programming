# 0x09. C - Static libraries

In this project, we studied what dynamic libraries are, how to create and index them, as well as how to link them into an executable file<br>
Here are the tasks in the project:

## Tasks :clipboard:

### 0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life

- Here, i copied all the prototypes and their source files into one directory
- I then created object files of these c files and then archived them to create the static library

### 1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future

- Here, I created one bash executable that does all the above at once
- It has to be executable
