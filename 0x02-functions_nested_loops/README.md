# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
In this project, we learnt the concept of functions and nested loops <br>


Here are the tasks in this project: <br>
## Tasks :clipboard:
### 1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
- To print the alphabet using ``_putchar``, use a ``for`` loop to go through every character in the alphabet and print

### 2. 10 x alphabet
- To loop the alphabet ten times, use a nested loop to print 10 times

### 3. islower
- Here, we use the ``ASCII`` table ``(man ASCII)`` to check the decima notation number assigned to the lower case characters and loop through them i.e ``c >= 97 && c <= 122``

### 4. isalpha
- Here, we use the same technique but now the decimal number assigned to uppercase characters ranges  41 - 90.

### 5. Sign
