# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
In this project, we learnt the concept of functions and nested loops <br>


Here are the tasks in this project: <br>
## Tasks :clipboard:
### 1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
- To print the alphabet using ``_putchar``, use a ``for`` loop to go through every character in the alphabet and print

### 2. 10 x alphabet
- To loop the alphabet ten times, use a nested loop to print 10 times

### 3. islower
- Here, we use the ``ASCII`` table ``(man ASCII)`` to check the decima notation number assigned to the lower case characters and loop through them i.e ``c >= 97 && c <= 122``

### 4. isalpha
- Here, we use the same technique but now the decimal number assigned to uppercase characters ranges  41 - 90.

### 5. Sign
- Here, we use an ``if...else`` statements to go through each scenario

### 6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you
- Here, we can negate al negative numbers using if statement

### 7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
- Here, the modulus (%) operator will show the last digit of a number

### 8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life
- Use a nested loop for hour and minutes

### 9. Learn your times table
- To create a 9 times table, use a nested loop with the out loop being the number and the inner loop hving the product

### 10. a + b
- For this one, just return the sum of the inputs

### 11. 98 Battery Street, the OG
- Build two cases, one with n being more than 98 (thus n--) and the other wih n being less than 98 (thus n++)
